# CPU_in_Python
Following the book "But how do it work", I want to try coding up a CPU in python.
Of course, this project might seem overkill to do it in python but I wanted to implement first-hand the theory I am learning!
The theory of computation fascinates me : the very fact that we can build things up with simple objects like bits and NAND gates to result in something that can allow us to 
play games and explore virtual worlds blows my mind consistently. This project serves to solidy my foundations in that.
